# Public Assets

Place your Fountain Vitality logo file here as `fountain-logo.png`.

## Logo Requirements

- **File name**: `fountain-logo.png`
- **Recommended size**: 40x40px to 80x80px (will be scaled to 40x40px)
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (preferred) or JPG
- **File location**: `/public/fountain-logo.png`

The logo will automatically appear in the navigation bar. If the file doesn't exist, the text "Fountain Vitality" will be displayed instead.

## Alternative Formats

If you have the logo in a different format, you can:
1. Convert it to PNG
2. Or update `components/Nav.tsx` to use your file name/format
